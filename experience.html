          <h2>Early Coding</h2>
          <p>
            I have been familiar with the web development field for just over about a year now. The reason I have enrolled in TeamTreeHouse is because I wanted to brush up on my existing skill as well as hoping to learn key tips along the way. I first started out by learning HTML/CSS, and then JavaScript shortly after. After I feel comfortable enough developing websites on the front-end, I hope to move on and to learn back-end development as well.

            In the beginning, it wasn't easy. Looking at all these numbers, characters, symbols was a little bit intimidating at first. I took the challenge day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute. I felt like if I did not code for a day, I'd feel like I would forget something. When I first looked at JavaScript I thought I would never understand it, because it was so different from CSS and HTML. But in the end, I realize it's all just muscle and mind memory. Do a little bit of coding every day and it will become second nature.
